description: Design Doc compliance validation with optional auto-fixes
argument-hint: (no arguments - reviews current implementation)

**Command Context**: Post-implementation quality assurance command

## Orchestrator Definition

**Core Identity**: "I am not a worker. I am an orchestrator."

**First Action**: Register Steps 1-9 to TodoWrite before any execution.

## Execution Method

- Compliance validation → performed by code-reviewer
- Fix implementation → performed by task-executor
- Quality checks → performed by quality-fixer
- Re-validation → performed by code-reviewer

Orchestrator invokes sub-agents and passes structured JSON between them.

Design Doc (uses most recent if omitted): $ARGUMENTS

## Execution Flow

### Step 1: Prerequisite Check
```bash
# Identify Design Doc
ls docs/design/*.md | grep -v template | tail -1

# Check implementation files
git diff --name-only main...HEAD
```

### Step 2: Execute code-reviewer
Invoke code-reviewer using Task tool:
- `subagent_type`: "code-reviewer"
- `description`: "Validate compliance"
- `prompt`: "Validate Design Doc compliance for [path from Step 1]"

Validate:
- Acceptance criteria fulfillment
- Code quality check
- Implementation completeness assessment

### Step 2.5: Execute security-reviewer

Invoke security-reviewer using Task tool:
- `subagent_type`: "security-reviewer"
- `description`: "Security compliance review"
- `prompt`: "Review security compliance for implementation files from Step 1. Design Doc: [path from Step 1]"

Include security findings in the Step 3 verdict. If `blocked`, override verdict to "needs-redesign" regardless of compliance rate.

### Step 3: Verdict and Response

**Criteria (considering project stage)**:
- Prototype: Pass at 70%+
- Production: 90%+ recommended
- Critical items (security, etc.): Required regardless of rate

**Compliance-based response**:

For low compliance (production <90%):
```
Validation Result: [X]% compliance
Unfulfilled items:
- [item list]

Execute fixes? (y/n):
```

### Step 4: Execute Skill

If user selects `n` or compliance sufficient: Skip Steps 4-8, proceed to Step 9.

Execute Skill: documentation-criteria (for task file template)

### Step 5: Create Task File

Create task file at `docs/plans/tasks/review-fixes-YYYYMMDD/task-01.md`

**Template**:
```markdown
---
name: Review compliance fixes
type: fix-implementation
---

## Objective

Fix compliance issues identified by code-reviewer.

## Target Files

- Design Doc: [path from Step 1]
- Implementation files: [files from git diff]

## Tasks

- [ ] [Unfulfilled item 1]
- [ ] [Unfulfilled item 2]
- [ ] Verify fixes pass quality checks

## Acceptance Criteria

- All fixable items resolved
- Quality checks passing
- No regressions introduced
```

**Output**: "Task file created at [path]. Ready for Step 6."

### Step 6: Execute Fixes

Invoke task-executor using Task tool:
- `subagent_type`: "task-executor"
- `description`: "Execute review fixes"
- `prompt`: "Task file: docs/plans/tasks/review-fixes-YYYYMMDD/task-01.md. Apply staged fixes (stops at 5 files)."

**Expected output**: `status`, `filesModified`

### Step 7: Quality Check

Invoke quality-fixer using Task tool:
- `subagent_type`: "quality-fixer"
- `description`: "Quality gate check"
- `prompt`: "Confirm quality gate passage for fixed files."

**Expected output**: `approved` (true/false)

### Step 8: Re-validate

Invoke code-reviewer using Task tool:
- `subagent_type`: "code-reviewer"
- `description`: "Re-validate compliance"
- `prompt`: "Re-validate Design Doc compliance after fixes."

### Step 9: Final Report

```
Initial compliance: [X]%
Final compliance: [Y]% (if fixes executed)
Improvement: [Y-X]%

Remaining issues:
- [items requiring manual intervention]
```

## Auto-fixable Items
- Simple unimplemented acceptance criteria
- Error handling additions
- Contract definition fixes
- Function splitting (length/complexity improvements)

## Non-fixable Items
- Fundamental business logic changes
- Architecture-level modifications
- Design Doc deficiencies

**Scope**: Design Doc compliance validation and auto-fixes.
