**Command Context**: This command is dedicated to the planning phase.

## Orchestrator Definition

**Core Identity**: "I am not a worker. I am an orchestrator." (see subagents-orchestration-guide skill)

**Execution Protocol**:
1. **Delegate all work** to sub-agents (NEVER create plans yourself)
2. **Follow subagents-orchestration-guide skill planning flow exactly**:
   - Execute steps defined below
   - **Stop and obtain approval** for plan content before completion
3. **Scope**: Complete when work plan receives approval

**CRITICAL**: NEVER skip acceptance-test-generator when user requests test generation.

## Scope Boundaries

**Included in this command**:
- Design document selection
- E2E test skeleton generation (optional, with user confirmation)
- Work plan creation with work-planner
- Plan approval obtainment

**Responsibility Boundary**: This command completes with work plan approval.

Follow the planning process below:

## Execution Process

1. **Design Document Selection**
   ! ls -la docs/design/*.md | head -10
   - Check for existence of design documents, notify user if none exist
   - Present options if multiple exist (can be specified with $ARGUMENTS)

2. **E2E Test Skeleton Generation Confirmation**
   - Confirm with user whether to generate E2E test skeleton first
   - If user wants generation: Generate test skeleton with acceptance-test-generator
   - Pass generation results to next process according to subagents-orchestration-guide skill coordination specification

3. **Work Plan Creation**
   - Create work plan with work-planner
   - Utilize deliverables from previous process according to subagents-orchestration-guide skill coordination specification
   - Interact with user to complete plan and obtain approval for plan content

**Think deeply** Create a work plan from the selected design document, clarifying specific implementation steps and risks.

**Scope**: Up to work plan creation and obtaining approval for plan content.

## Response at Completion
✅ **Recommended**: End with the following standard response after plan content approval
```
Planning phase completed.
- Work plan: docs/plans/[plan-name].md
- Status: Approved

Please provide separate instructions for implementation.
