Change request: $ARGUMENTS

**Think deeply** Extract the TRUE INTENT behind user's change request and implement with MAXIMUM PRECISION to eliminate ALL ambiguity:

## 9 Optimization Perspectives

1. Context efficiency vs execution accuracy - Maximum accuracy with minimal description
2. Deduplication - Consistency within and across skill files
3. Proper responsibility aggregation - Group related content (minimize read operations)
4. Clear decision criteria - Measurable standards
5. Transform negatives to recommendations - Recommended format (background: including NG examples)
6. Consistent notation - Unified expressions
7. Explicit prerequisites - Make implicit assumptions visible
8. Optimized description order - Most important first, exceptions last
9. Clear scope boundaries - What's covered vs what's not

## Execution Flow

### 1. Understand the Request

Question template when unspecified:

```
1. Which skill to modify?
   e.g.: typescript-rules / coding-standards / documentation-criteria

2. Select change type:
   a) Add new criteria (add new standards)
   b) Modify existing criteria (clarify ambiguous descriptions)
   c) Delete criteria (remove obsolete standards)

3. Specific changes:
   e.g.: "Add rule prohibiting 'any' type usage"
   e.g.: "Clarify error handling criteria"
   [User input]
```

### 2. Create Design Proposal

Target file identification and current state check:

```
# Tool selection criteria (measurable decisions)
if skill name is explicitly provided:
  Read: .claude/skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md direct read
else if partial skill name known:
  Glob: .claude/skills/*{keyword}*/SKILL.md search
  Read: Check identified file's current state
else:
  Glob: .claude/skills/*/SKILL.md for full scan
  Confirm target skill selection with user
```

Design template:

```
【Current】
"Handle errors appropriately" (ambiguous: "appropriately" undefined)

【Understanding User Request】
"Want stricter error handling" → Set measurable criteria

【Proposal】
"Error handling implementation criteria:
1. try-catch required for:
   - External API calls (fetch, axios, etc.)
   - File I/O operations (fs.readFile, etc.)
   - Parsing operations (JSON.parse, parseInt, etc.)
2. Required error log items:
   - error.name (error type)
   - error.stack (location)
   - Timestamp (ISO 8601 format)
3. User notification criteria:
   - No technical details (NG: stack trace display)
   - Clear action items (recommended: "Please try again")"

Proceed with this design? (y/n)
```

#### Before/After Visualization

Present changes in clear diff format for easy review:
```diff
- "Handle errors appropriately" (ambiguous)
+ "Error handling: try-catch required for external API calls, file I/O, parsing.
+  Log: error.name, error.stack, ISO timestamp.
+  User notification: no technical details, clear action items."
```

### 2.5 Quality Grading (Optional)

Apply skill-optimization grading system to evaluate the proposed change:
- **A grade**: All critical patterns resolved, clear decision criteria
- **B grade**: Critical patterns resolved, minor gaps
- **C grade**: Critical patterns remaining — recommend additional revision before approval

Include grade in the approval presentation at Step 4.

### 3. Three-Pass Review Process

#### Pass 1: Add for Maximum Accuracy【Addition-Only Mode】

Declaration: "Pass 1: Addition mode execution. Deletions are prohibited."

- Convert all ambiguous expressions → measurable criteria
  Example: "large" → "100+ lines" "5+ files"
- Make all implicit prerequisites explicit
  Example: "In TypeScript environment" "Within async functions"
- Define all exceptions and edge cases
  Example: "When null/undefined" "For empty arrays"
  Report: Count added items (minimum 5 items)

#### Pass 2: Critical Modification to Reduce Redundancy【Actual Modification Mode】

Declaration: "Pass 2: Critical modification mode execution. Actually delete and consolidate redundant parts."

Modification work:

1. Critically review all Pass 1 additions
2. Apply modifications using these criteria:
   - Duplicate concepts → Consolidate
   - Overly detailed explanations → Simplify
   - Overlap with other skills → Replace with references
3. Record complete before/after diff (deletion reasons required)

Report format:

```
Modified locations: X items
Deleted/consolidated content:
- [Before]: "Detailed description"
  [After]: "Concise description"
  [Reason]: Redundancy elimination
```

#### Pass 3: Accuracy Assurance via Diff Evaluation【Restoration Decision Mode】

Declaration: "Pass 3: Diff evaluation mode execution. Review all Pass 2 modifications and restore if accuracy compromised."

Verification work:

1. Evaluate each Pass 2 modification:
   - Does deletion create implementation ambiguity? → Restore
   - Are edge cases still covered? → Restore if missing
2. Action mapping:
   - Deletions with accuracy risks → Restore
   - Valid deletions → Keep

Final confirmation (required answer):
"Are necessary and sufficient conditions present for accurate implementation of user requirements?"

Report: Number of restored items and final reduction percentage

### 4. Get Approval

Present before/after comparison for user approval.

### 5. Implementation

1. Apply changes with appropriate tool (after user approval)
2. Final verification with git diff
3. Suggest `/sync-skills` execution

## Decision Criteria Checklist

- [ ] Expressible in "if-then" format ("if X then Y")
- [ ] Measurable by numbers/counts/states (eliminate subjective judgment)
- [ ] Related content aggregated in single file (minimize read operations)
- [ ] Relationships with other skills specified (dependencies/references/delegation)
- [ ] NG examples included as background information
- [ ] All prerequisites explicitly stated
