## 6-Phase Game Development Structure

### Phase 1: Core Mechanics
**Owner**: mechanics-developer
**Focus**: Game systems, state machines, physics, collision, input handling, object pooling, event systems

Tasks in this phase cover:
- Game loop and update cycle architecture
- State machine implementations (game states, entity states)
- Physics and collision systems
- Input handling and action mapping
- Object pooling and entity management
- Event/message bus systems
- Core data structures and game configuration

**Completion Criteria**: All core systems functional and testable in isolation without visual components. Unit tests pass. State transitions verified.

### Phase 2: Game Feel & Polish
**Owner**: game-feel-developer
**Depends on**: Phase 1 (Core Mechanics) — needs systems to attach feedback to

**Focus**: Screen shake, particles, audio cues, tweens, juice effects, feedback systems

Tasks in this phase cover:
- Screen shake and camera effects
- Particle system integration
- Audio cue triggers and sound management
- Tween/easing animations for UI and gameplay
- Hit feedback (freeze frames, flash effects, knockback)
- Input responsiveness tuning
- Visual and haptic feedback loops

**Completion Criteria**: All feedback systems attached to core mechanics triggers. Feedback type (visual/audio/haptic) and trigger conditions verified per task. Game feel metrics validated through playtesting.

### Phase 3: Art Integration
**Owner**: technical-artist
**Depends on**: Partially parallel with Phase 1 — asset pipeline is independent, but integration requires mechanics

**Focus**: Asset pipeline, texture atlases, sprite sheets, shaders, visual effects, animation systems

Tasks in this phase cover:
- Asset loading pipeline and manifest configuration
- Texture atlas generation and sprite sheet management
- Shader/pipeline development (WebGL)
- Animation system integration (sprite animations, skeletal)
- Visual effects (post-processing, blending)
- Asset format validation and fallback behavior
- Performance profiling of render systems

**Completion Criteria**: All art assets integrated with correct format and atlas requirements. Fallback behavior verified. Render performance within frame budget on target platform.

### Phase 4: UI Implementation
**Owner**: ui-ux-agent
**Depends on**: Phase 1 (game state) and Phase 3 (visual assets)

**Focus**: HUD, menus, game flow screens, transitions, accessibility, input feedback

Tasks in this phase cover:
- HUD elements (health, score, inventory display)
- Menu systems (main menu, pause, settings, game over)
- Game flow screens and scene transitions
- UI animation and transition effects
- Accessibility features (colorblind modes, text scaling, input remapping)
- Input feedback visualization
- Game state transitions referenced from GDD

**Completion Criteria**: All UI screens implemented per GDD game flow. State transitions match game state machine. Accessibility requirements met. UI responsive across target resolutions.

### Phase 5: Analytics & Telemetry
**Owner**: data-scientist
**Depends on**: Can parallel Phases 3-4 — event schema is independent of visuals

**Focus**: Event tracking, dashboards, A/B framework, KPI monitoring, session recording

Tasks in this phase cover:
- Analytics event schema definition
- Event tracking instrumentation across game systems
- Dashboard configuration and KPI visualization
- A/B testing framework integration
- Session recording and replay capability
- Player behavior funnel tracking
- Performance telemetry (frame times, load times, memory)

**Completion Criteria**: All specified events tracked with correct schema. Dashboard displays KPIs. A/B framework operational. Event data validated end-to-end.

### Phase 6: QA & Performance
**Owner**: qa-agent
**Depends on**: All previous phases, but can start performance testing early (after Phase 1)

**Focus**: Test plans, performance validation, playtesting protocols, frame budget, memory profiling

Tasks in this phase cover:
- Comprehensive test plan execution
- Performance profiling and optimization (frame budget enforcement)
- Memory leak detection and profiling
- Platform compatibility testing
- Regression testing across all systems
- Playtesting protocol execution and feedback collection
- Final integration verification (all systems working together)
- Build pipeline validation

**Completion Criteria**: All tests pass. Frame budget met on target platform (e.g., 60fps sustained). No memory leaks. Regression suite clean. Playtesting feedback addressed.

## Phase Dependency Summary

```
Phase 1 (Core Mechanics)
  ├──> Phase 2 (Game Feel) — strict dependency
  ├──> Phase 3 (Art Integration) — partial: pipeline independent, integration after mechanics
  └──> Phase 6 (QA) — can start performance baseline testing early

Phase 1 + Phase 3
  └──> Phase 4 (UI) — needs game state + visual assets

Phases 3-4 (parallel)
  └──> Phase 5 (Analytics) — event schema independent, instrumentation after systems exist

Phases 1-5
  └──> Phase 6 (QA) — full test suite after all systems complete
```

## Important Task Design Principles

1. **Executable Granularity**: Each task as logical 1-commit unit, clear completion criteria, explicit dependencies
2. **Built-in Quality**: Simultaneous test implementation, quality checks in each phase
3. **Risk Management**: List risks and countermeasures in advance, define detection methods
4. **Ensure Flexibility**: Prioritize essential purpose, avoid excessive detail
5. **Design Doc Compliance**: All task completion criteria derived from Design Doc and GDD specifications
6. **Implementation Pattern Consistency**: When including implementation samples, MUST ensure strict compliance with Design Doc implementation approach

### Game Development Task Decomposition Principles

- **Core Mechanics tasks** should be isolated and testable without visual components — pure logic, no rendering dependencies
- **Game Feel tasks** must specify feedback type (visual/audio/haptic) and trigger conditions for each effect
- **Art Integration tasks** must specify asset format, atlas requirements, and fallback behavior for missing/loading assets
- **UI tasks** must reference game state transitions from GDD and specify responsive behavior across target resolutions
- **Analytics tasks** must specify event schema (event name, properties, types) and dashboard requirements per metric
- **QA tasks** must include frame budget targets (e.g., 60fps on target platform), memory ceiling, and acceptable variance

### Task Completion Definition: 3 Elements
1. **Implementation Complete**: Code functions (including existing code investigation)
2. **Quality Complete**: Tests, static checking, linting pass
3. **Integration Complete**: Coordination with other game systems verified

Include completion conditions in task names (e.g., "State machine implementation and unit test creation")

## Implementation Strategy Selection

### Strategy A: Test-Driven Development (when test design information provided)

#### Phase 0: Test Preparation (Unit Tests Only)
Create Red state tests based on unit test definitions provided from previous process.

**Test Implementation Timing**:
- Unit tests: Phase 0 Red → Green during implementation
- Integration tests: Create and execute at completion of implementation (Red-Green-Refactor not applied)
- E2E tests: Execute only in final phase (Red-Green-Refactor not applied)

#### Meta Information Utilization
Analyze meta information (@category, @dependency, @complexity, etc.) included in test definitions,
phase placement in order from low dependency and low complexity.

### Strategy B: Implementation-First Development (when no test design information)

#### Start from Phase 1
Prioritize implementation, add tests as needed in each phase.
Gradually ensure quality based on Design Doc and GDD acceptance criteria.

### Test Design Information Processing (when provided)
**Processing when test skeleton file paths provided from previous process**:

#### Step 1: Read Test Skeleton Files (Required)
Read test skeleton files (integration tests, E2E tests) with the Read tool and extract meta information from comments.

**Comment patterns to extract**:
- `// @category:` → Test classification (core-functionality, edge-case, e2e, etc.)
- `// @dependency:` → Dependent components (material for phase placement decisions)
- `// @complexity:` → Complexity (high/medium/low, material for effort estimation)
- `// ROI:` → Priority judgment

#### Step 2: Reflect Meta Information in Work Plan

1. **Dependency-based Phase Placement**
   - `// @dependency: none` → Place in earlier phases
   - `// @dependency: [component name]` → Place in phase after dependent component implementation
   - `// @dependency: full-system` → Place in final phase

2. **Complexity-based Effort Estimation**
   - `// @complexity: high` → Subdivide tasks or estimate higher effort
   - `// @complexity: low` → Consider combining multiple tests into one task

#### Step 3: Classify and Place Tests

**Test Classification**:
- Setup items (Mock preparation, measurement tools, Helpers, etc.) → Prioritize in Phase 1
- Unit tests (individual functions) → Start from Phase 0 with Red-Green-Refactor
- Integration tests → Place as create/execute tasks when relevant feature implementation is complete
- E2E tests → Place as execute-only tasks in final phase
- Non-functional requirement tests (performance, frame budget, memory) → Place in Phase 6 (QA & Performance)
- Risk levels ("high risk", "required", etc.) → Move to earlier phases

**Task Generation Principles**:
- Always decompose 5+ test cases into subtasks (setup/high risk/normal/low risk)
- Specify "X test implementations" in each task (quantify progress)
- Specify traceability: Show correspondence with acceptance criteria in "AC1 support (3 items)" format

**Measurement Tool Implementation**:
- Measurement tests like "frame rate measurement", "memory profiling", "input latency testing" → Create dedicated implementation tasks
- Auto-add "simple algorithm implementation" task when external libraries not used

**Completion Condition Quantification**:
- Add progress indicator "Test case resolution: X/Y items" to each phase
- Final phase required condition: Specific numbers like "Unresolved tests: 0 achieved (all resolved)"

## Task Decomposition Principles

### Property-Based Test Documentation in Work Plans

When the Design Doc or acceptance-test-generator identifies property-based test candidates, the work plan MUST include:

1. **Property Test Tasks**: Dedicated tasks for implementing property tests, placed in the phase AFTER the feature implementation they verify
2. **Generator Specification**: Each property test task must specify what input generators are needed
3. **Invariant Documentation**: Clear statement of what property must hold

Example task entry:
```
### Task: Implement property tests for [game system]
- Properties to verify: [list from acceptance-test-generator]
- Generator requirements: [input types and ranges, e.g., entity positions, velocity vectors]
- Expected shrink behavior: [what minimal failing case looks like]
- Dependencies: [feature implementation task must complete first]
```

**Placement Rule**: Property test tasks go in the same phase as integration tests for the related feature. They should NOT be in the final QA phase.

### Test Placement Principles
**Phase Placement Rules**:
- Integration tests: Include in relevant phase tasks like "[System name] implementation with integration test creation"
- E2E tests: Place "E2E test execution" in Phase 6 (implementation not needed, execution only)

### Implementation Approach Application
Decompose tasks based on implementation approach and technical dependencies decided in Design Doc, following verification levels (L1/L2/L3) from implementation-approach skill.

### Task Dependency Minimization Rules
- Dependencies up to 2 levels maximum (A→B→C acceptable, A→B→C→D requires redesign)
- Reconsider division for 3+ chain dependencies
- Each task provides value independently as much as possible

### Phase Composition
Compose 6 phases based on game development lifecycle and technical dependencies from Design Doc.
Always include quality assurance and performance validation in Phase 6.

### Operational Verification
Place operational verification procedures for each integration point from Design Doc in corresponding phases.

### Task Dependencies
- Clearly define dependencies between game systems
- Explicitly identify tasks that can run in parallel (e.g., asset pipeline and core mechanics)
- Include integration points in task names

## Diagram Creation (using mermaid notation)

When creating work plans, **Phase Structure Diagrams** and **Task Dependency Diagrams** are mandatory. Add Gantt charts when time constraints exist.

**Phase Structure Diagram** must show the 6-phase game development lifecycle with dependency arrows.
