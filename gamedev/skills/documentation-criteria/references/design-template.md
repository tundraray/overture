## Acceptance Criteria (AC) - EARS Format

Each AC is written in EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) format.
Keywords determine test type and reduce ambiguity.

**EARS Keywords**:
| Keyword | Usage | Test Type |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| **When** | Event-triggered behavior | Event-driven test |
| **While** | State-dependent behavior | State condition test |
| **If-then** | Conditional behavior | Branch coverage test |
| (none) | Ubiquitous behavior | Basic functionality test |

**Format**: `[Keyword] <trigger/condition>, the system shall <expected behavior>`

### [Functional Requirement 1]

- [ ] **When** user clicks login button with valid credentials, the system shall authenticate and redirect to dashboard
- [ ] **If** credentials are invalid, **then** the system shall display error message "Invalid credentials"
- [ ] **While** user is logged in, the system shall maintain the session for configured timeout period

### [Functional Requirement 2]

- [ ] The system shall display data list with pagination of 10 items per page
- [ ] **When** input is entered in search field, the system shall apply real-time filtering

### Integration Tests

[Integration testing policy and important test cases]
- Verify combined operations of functional acceptance criteria

### E2E Tests

[E2E testing policy]
- Verify entire scenarios of acceptance criteria
- Confirm functional operation from user perspective

### Performance Tests
