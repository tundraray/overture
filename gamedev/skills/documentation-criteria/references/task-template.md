# Task: [Task Name]

Metadata:
- Dependencies: task-01 → Deliverable: docs/plans/analysis/research-results.md
- Provides: docs/plans/analysis/api-spec.md (for research/design tasks)
- Size: Small (1-2 files)

## Implementation Content
[What this task will achieve]
*Reference dependency deliverables if applicable

## Target Files
- [ ] [Implementation file path]
- [ ] [Test file path]

## Implementation Steps (TDD: Red-Green-Refactor)
### 1. Red Phase
- [ ] Review dependency deliverables (if any)
- [ ] Verify/create contract definitions
- [ ] Write failing tests
- [ ] Run tests and confirm failure

### 2. Green Phase
- [ ] Add minimal implementation to pass tests
- [ ] Run only added tests and confirm they pass

### 3. Refactor Phase
- [ ] Improve code (maintain passing tests)
- [ ] Confirm added tests still pass

## Completion Criteria
- [ ] All added tests pass
- [ ] Operation verified (select L1/L2/L3, per implementation-approach skill)
- [ ] Deliverables created (for research/design tasks)

## Notes
- Impact scope: [Areas where changes may propagate]
- Constraints: [Areas not to be modified]
